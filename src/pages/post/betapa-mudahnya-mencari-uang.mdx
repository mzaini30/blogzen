Making money nowadays is quite easy. You can write blogs, make videos, create Android applications, sell at Shopee, become a Shopee Agent, and various other digital jobs. How to do it is quite easy. It's enough for you to start. The easiest, of course, is to become a blogger. All it takes is writing. What is written? Just write freely. But, don't forget the two things that must be installed on the blog are Google Analytics and Google Adsense.

Okay, first I will discuss the blog first. What needs to be written? Just write freely. Then, when there's quite a lot of writing, you can open Google Analytics, then look at the report, what posts are being read the most this week. Examples like this:

So, from there it will be seen, what post titles are currently busy. So, for the next, we post something similar to that. Hopefully, the next posts will get a lot of viewers too.

This method also works on Android apps if you are an Android app developer or YouTube statistics (48 hours realtime) if you are a YouTuber.
