One of the biggest challenges for novice YouTubers is getting 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours. Sounds impossible, can you get it? Until finally, if we are impatient, we will use fraudulent methods to get 4,000 watch hours and 1,000 subscribers earlier.

In fact, the rules were made to make it easier for us to monetize every work we have. Try it, if we only have a small amount of work, only a few videos, it will be difficult to get sufficient income from YouTube. So, not without reason, yes, the rules were made. It will make it easier for us.

Now the question is, how to get a lot of viewers in a short time? Well, this is what YouTube wants, namely our curiosity to get this minimal achievement.

So, the highly recommended way is to follow the trend. What trend do you follow? If we follow the trending column on YouTube, then we will be overwhelmed if this trend that is currently viral is a trend that does not match the theme of our video. Or, this trend is in a realm that is not our discussion; whether it's a difficult discussion or not connected with the theme of our channel.

So, the solution to following this trend is only one, which is to see what our videos are busy for 48 hours. Then, we make a video similar to the trending video. So, it will be very easy to get the next viewer in this way.

Examples are like this:

The data is obtained on the YouTube Studio page. So, we can see in the last 48 hours, which videos are popular.

From the data above, we can find that the videos that are currently popular are:

1. Build Chrome Extension with Svelte
2. Using Windi CSS in Svelte
3. Simple Way to Generate UUID

So, henceforth, we just make videos that are related or similar to these videos.

However, this method can also be applied to other platforms. For example, for Android applications and blogs. If you want to make an application that has many views, then open Admob and see what are the most popular applications. So, you create an application that is similar to the application.

For example, this is what it looks like in Admob:

There you can see the 5 most popular applications to date. So, make similar applications.

If the blog is also like that. That means, we open the Google Analytics page, then look at the posts that have a lot of visitors. So, we make a post similar to the post.

Quite easy. But, if we don't do it from now on, then we will continue to have trouble getting viewers. So, immediately do the things that I have mentioned above.
